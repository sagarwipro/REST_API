I used POSTMAN, Node.JS, Express, MySQL, JS and JSON mainly.<br/>
![alt text](https://github.com/sagarwipro/sagarwipro.github.io/blob/master/images/nodejs.jpg?raw=true) **Node.js** maintains the services alive in background like routing the links on the right path and right JS extentionable files.<br/>
![alt text](https://github.com/sagarwipro/sagarwipro.github.io/blob/master/images/mysql.png?raw=true) **MySQL** service is used for fetching, updating, deleting and creating the data with the help of nodejs.<br/>
Where ![alt text](https://github.com/sagarwipro/sagarwipro.github.io/blob/master/images/js.jpg?raw=true) ** JS** is used to convert the JSON format into string and array to JSON format. Here we used callback functions also.<br/>
Finally, I checked it through ![alt text](https://github.com/sagarwipro/sagarwipro.github.io/blob/master/images/postman.jpg?raw=true) ** PostMan**'s  all response were expected with the response(status, header and body).
